I investigate how complex physical systems can be understood through neural-network quantum states. My work blends physics, neuronal dynamics and machine learning, with the focus of achieving energy-efficient simulation of physical systems.

This is a place where I explain the concepts I am working through: quantum models, numerical methods, architectures like Mixers, RNNs, and Transformers, and the broader tools that make scientific computing fast and reliable. I write for curious readers, technical or not, and for teams looking for someone who can solve deep problems and communicate them clearly

Beyond the  [research notes and articles]({{< relref "/posts" >}}), you can also explore a hands‑on **Sampling Playground**, where I host pretrained neural quantum state models. The playground allows you to draw Monte Carlo samples from these models, inspect configurations, and download the full dataset of samples. If you are curious about how these models behave or want to experiment with different Hamiltonians and lattice sizes, you can try it here:
